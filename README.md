# Books

### I enjoy reading books for many reasons. Firstly, I love that books offer a gateway to different worlds and perspectives. I love the fact that I can truly immerse myself in that world. Books have the power to transport me into a different world. My favorite series is definitely Game of thrones. Game of thrones is very detailed and captivating. The dialogue, world building, and storytelling is amazing. I also love the fact that most of the plot you can never tell what was going to happen.  My favorite character is Tyrion.
